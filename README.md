# Cloud Security Scenarios on OCI: Architecture in Action

This repository showcases practical, real-world Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) security architecture scenarios ‚Äî crafted from the perspective of a cloud security engineer. Each scenario addresses challenges professionals face when designing secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud environments in high-stakes enterprise settings.

### What You'll Find Inside

Each folder includes:

- üöÄ A real-world, business-driven cloud security use case
- ‚öñÔ∏è Strategic analysis of trade-offs, risks, and design priorities  
- üß© High-level Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) architecture diagrams

### Why This Matters

These scenarios mirror the workflows and decision-making of cloud security engineers in enterprise environments. They demonstrate how to:
- Translate business objectives into secure, scalable cloud architectures
- Balance competing priorities such as speed, cost, compliance, and availability
- Leverage OCI services to address complex infrastructure and security challenges
- Clearly communicate technical designs to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

## üìÅ Scenario Examples

1. [**Data Analytics Platform Launch**](./scenarios/01-data-analytics-platform/scenario.md)  
   Fast 90-day launch with a $10k/month budget and minimal DevOps experience. Focus on cost control, scalability, and high availability.

2. [**HIPAA & GxP-Compliant Data Lake**](./scenarios/02-hipaa-gxp-data-lake/scenario.md)  
   IAM integration with Active Directory, encryption at rest and in transit, using OCI Vault and Cloud Guard for compliance.

3. [**Multi-Region High Availability Setup**](./scenarios/03-multi-region-high-availability/scenario.md)  
   Selecting availability and fault domains, auto-scaling strategies, data replication methods, and disaster recovery objectives.
